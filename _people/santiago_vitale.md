### Bio

Santiago Vitale (Santi) is a Postdoctoral Research at Yatiris. Santiago's thesis is focused in introducing novel ultrasound simulation techniques to train technicians in controlled environments. He's currently investigating different ray-casting and deep learning methods to simulate abdominal ultrasound images. Santiago Vitale received a B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering at UNICEN in 2018 and his PhD in Computational and Industrial Mathematics in 2023. He is working with us with a research scholarship granted by CONICET.
